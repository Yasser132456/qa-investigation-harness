# Stage 3: challenge

Read qa-harness/RULES.md first if you have not already this session.

Input: the ticket ID.

This stage has two parts. Part B runs only after the human has edited
risks.md — do not run it in the same turn as Part A unless the human
explicitly asks you to skip the review pause (they shouldn't).

Read qa-artifacts/<ticket>/exploration.md and qa-artifacts/<ticket>/flow-model.md.
Write no test code.

--- PART A: risk table ---

For each state, each transition (especially unobserved ones), each item under
"Observed but not in the test case", and the flow as a whole, ask:
- What could fail here?
- What does the test case assume without verifying?
- What evidence would actually prove success?
- Is that evidence observable from the browser?

Write to qa-artifacts/<ticket>/risks.md:

```markdown
# Risks: <flow name>
Ticket: <ticket ID>
Source: flow-model.md (<date from that file>)
Challenged: <ISO date>

| ID | Step/State | Risk | Proposed oracle | Observable | Status |
|----|------------|------|-----------------|------------|--------|
| R1 | ...        | ...  | ...             | yes/no/partial | PROPOSED |
```

Rules:
- Every row starts PROPOSED. Never write APPROVED or REJECTED.
- APPROVED will mean "this risk is real and should be covered." Write each
  row so that decision is answerable in one read.
- Describe oracles in prose. Never write them as code.
- Name the oracle that would ACTUALLY prove success, even when it requires an
  API or database check this project cannot yet perform. Mark those "no" or
  "partial". Never substitute a weaker browser-only check because it is
  reachable today.
- A rendered confirmation message is not evidence of a completed action. Flag
  any row whose only oracle is rendered text as an evidence gap in the Risk
  column.
- Cover every unobserved transition from flow-model.md with at least one row.
- Over-generate. The human's job is rejection, so give candidates to reject
  rather than a pre-filtered list.
- Include at least two rows the browser cannot fully verify.

Then stop and tell the human to review risks.md before running Part B.

--- PART B: test plan for your project's test-generation agent ---

Run only when asked, and only after checking:
1. risks.md contains rows with status APPROVED. If zero, stop and say the
   review is still pending.
2. The Source date chain is intact: risks.md → flow-model.md →
   exploration.md. If any link is stale, say which stage needs re-running.

This writes specs/<ticket>.plan.md — the SAME kind of artifact a planner
agent would normally produce, in a plain documentation structure any
generator agent can read, so the human can hand it off directly.
See qa-harness/RULES.md for why a planner agent is not invoked here instead.

If specs/<ticket>.plan.md already exists:
- Read it first. Never renumber or rewrite existing TC-<NN> entries.
- Append new TC-<NN> entries for newly-approved risks, continuing the
  numbering from the highest existing TC number in the file.
- If the file has no existing entries for this exact flow, start at TC-01.

If your project already has an established plan-file format (check for
existing files under specs/ before writing), match that format exactly
instead of the template below — the goal is a file indistinguishable from
one written by hand. Otherwise use this structure:

```markdown
# <ticket ID> - <flow title>

## Application Overview

<one paragraph, written from exploration.md: what application/flow this
covers, its URL, and the screens or steps involved. Prose, third person, same
style as a human-written plan — do not mention risks, oracles, or this
harness.>

## Test Scenarios

### 1. <ticket ID> - <flow title>

**Seed:** `<seed file path from exploration.md's Candidate seed files, or, if
none was found, the literal text "NONE FOUND — a seed file must exist before
this can be generated">`

#### 1.<n>. TC-<NN>: <short title derived from the risk>

**File:** `<test file path following your project's existing naming
convention — check tests/ for the pattern before inventing one>`

**Steps:**
  1. <verified step from exploration.md, in the plan's plain action style>
    - expect: <the approved oracle, in prose, as a real behavioral assertion
      — this is what the generator turns into code>
  2. <next step>
    - expect: <...>
```

One `TC-<NN>` block per APPROVED risk row, numbered sequentially. Steps come
from exploration.md's verified path, not invented.

When a risk's Observable is "no" or "partial", still write a real `expect:`
bullet stating the approved oracle as-is (do not weaken it), then add one
more bullet immediately after it:
    - expect: GAP — browser cannot verify this. Correct oracle requires
      <what the approved oracle actually needs, e.g. an API/DB check>. Not
      wired into this project yet.
This keeps the gap visible to whoever reads the plan or the generated test,
without pretending the browser-level check is sufficient.

Then, in the SAME response, append a new section to the BOTTOM of
qa-artifacts/<ticket>/risks.md — after the existing risk table, which must
not otherwise be touched — recording the mapping just created:

```markdown

## Generated mapping (<ISO date>)
| Risk ID | TC ID | File |
|---------|-------|------|
| R1      | TC-04 | <file path> |
```

This mapping is what the validate stage uses later to connect an approved
risk to the test that's supposed to cover it. If Part B is run more than
once for this ticket, append a new dated "## Generated mapping" section each
time rather than overwriting the previous one.

Rules:
- Include APPROVED rows only. Ignore PROPOSED and REJECTED entirely, however
  important they appear.
- Write no code — steps and expectations are prose, in the plan's own
  documentation style, not assertions in TypeScript or any other language.
- specs/<ticket>.plan.md must read as a normal test plan. Do not mention
  risks.md, APPROVED status, or this harness inside it — that context lives
  in qa-artifacts/<ticket>/, referenced only from the mapping section in
  risks.md.
- If the seed file is "NONE FOUND", still write the plan, but say plainly to
  the human that generation cannot proceed until a seed file exists, and that
  creating one is outside this harness's authority.
- Do not claim the flow is adequately covered.
